I like the initial interface I see when I open the app. I can very clearly see what I am supposed to do and what I am supposed to click. However, when I take my picture and want to draw on it, it doesnâ€™t exactly draw correctly. There is a tutorial right in AppInventor that does at least part of the drawing that you were intending to do that might help you if you want to fix up the app. 

Another thing that happens is that the container you keep the picture inside is too big for the screen. Once I take a picture I can no longer take a new picture or scroll anywhere. 

I like the idea of your app and I like how you started, but I would have liked to see a little bit more progress. If you want to keep working on the app to make something you are really proud of, I am happy to help you.
